# Semester Mark management  

## _PROJECT GROUP 2_
                      
### To do for this project

The web app should be able to import an excel file that includes student data, store it in a database, calculate the CGPA of each student, and allow an admin panel to access and modify the data. It should also track how many times a student has written re-exams, display data in an organized manner, and allow both students and admins to download the data in Excel.
